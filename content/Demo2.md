# Demo 


This is a demonstration markdown file that can be loaded into the editor.

The minus sign next to the heading hash #- means 'not visible'.

This is 'stateful markdown'.

The visual editor means that someone does not need to 'know' markdown to get the idea, and they can still convert their work to markdown if needed.

This is a re-purposing of standard markdown to make it easier to work on components of traditional word processing documents, on the assumption that we want to include some meta-data and state changes with our markdown.

## Lower level heading

Alternatively, you can format the multi-line notes as code e.g. 



[filepath](/Users/craigduncan/Documents/2020_ComputerScience/NoisyGuts/56256.pdf)

[url](www.abc.net.au)

[x,y](610.0,220.0)

```
Second line.

Multi-line notes in a code section.


```

# Box 2

## Subheading

This will be captured as a separate box.

Each box is reduced to a single hashed heading when opened in the editor, plus it adds the notes function so that you can record notes.

Filtering out the notes lines should be easy.




[x,y](488.0,220.0)

# Final markdown

This should be the third box in the display.

Your presentation layout is relatively easy.

You can type it up as if it is a script.




[x,y](801.0,205.0)

```

If you have data-related markdown, then it can be ingested as a separate type of box in the editor.
